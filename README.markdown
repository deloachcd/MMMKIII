# The Ultimate Akai MPK Mini MK3 MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live

Forked from [SlyBouhafs](https://github.com/SlyBouhafs/MMMKIII) for the sake of making
some personal preference tweaks.

## Usage

The *BANK B* of the first two programs mirrors the device program, enabling quick 
switching between device mappings using the BANK A/B button. Note that the "CC" pad
mode on the controller must be enabled to use the bindings this script adds to *BANK A*.

## Installation

First, clone the repository.

1.	Make sure that Live isn't running.
2.	In the `assets/presets/` folder, there are 4 programs, use the MPK Mini MK3 Program Editor to load each one.
3.	Add **MMMKIII** to Ableton Live's MIDI Remote Scripts folder.

	[See Ableton’s help page regarding installing third-party remote scripts.](https://help.ableton.com/hc/en-us/articles/209072009-Installing-third-party-remote-scripts)

4.	Start Live.
5.	Enable **MMMKIII** as a Control Surface in Live

	In Live’s Preferences go to the **MIDI Sync** tab and select **MMMKIII** in the dropdown list of available Control Surfaces. For the MIDI Input and Output, select your controller’s MIDI-port.
