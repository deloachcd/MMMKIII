# The Ultimate Akai MPK Mini MK3 MIDI Remote Script for Ableton Live

Forked from [SlyBouhafs](https://github.com/SlyBouhafs/MMMKIII) for the sake of making
some personal preference tweaks.

## Usage

The *BANK B* of the first two programs mirrors the device program, enabling quick 
switching between device mappings using the BANK A/B button. Note that the "CC" pad
mode on the controller must be enabled to use the bindings this script adds to *BANK A*.
